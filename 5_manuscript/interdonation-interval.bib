  abstract = {\textbf{\emph{Background:}} Roughly one quarter of short-term temporary deferrals (STTD) of blood donors are low-hemoglobin deferrals (LHD), i.e. STTD due to a hemoglobin (Hb) value falling below a cutoff of 125 g/L for female and 135 g/L for male donors. Since voluntarily donating blood is a prosocial activity, donors may perceive deferral as social exclusion, which can cause social pain, decrease self-esteem, and lead to antisocial behavior. However, little is known about the causal impacts of LHD on donor return. \textbf{\emph{Study Design and Methods:}} We conducted a quasi-experiment with 80,060 donors invited to blood drives in the canton of Zurich, Switzerland, between 2009 and 2014. Within a narrow window of Hb values around the predetermined cutoff, the rate of LHD jumps discontinuously. This discontinuous jump allows us to quantify the causal effects of LHD on donor return, as it is uncorrelated with other unobserved factors that may also affect donor return. \textbf{\emph{Results:}} We found different behavioral reactions to LHD for female and male donors. Female donors do not react to the first LHD. However, after any repeated LHD, they are 13.53 percentage points (\emph{p} \emph{\&\#x3c;}0.001) less likely to make at least 1 donation attempt within the next 18 months and make 0.389 fewer donation attempts (\emph{p} \emph{\&\#x3c;}0.001). Male donors react to the first LHD. They are 5.32 percentage points (\emph{p} = 0.139) less likely to make at least 1 donation attempt over the next 18 months and make 0.227 (\emph{p} = 0.018) fewer donation attempts. After any repeated LHD, male donors are 13.30 percentage points (\emph{p} = 0.004) less likely to make at least 1 donation attempt and make 0.152 (\emph{p} = 0.308) fewer donation attempts. \textbf{\emph{Conclusion:}} LHD have detrimental impacts on donor return, especially if they occur repeatedly \textendash{} suggesting that avoiding false LHD and helping donors to better cope with them helps to maintain the pool of prospective donors.},

  abstract = {Background Donor retention is essential for blood banks because acquiring new donors is more expensive than retaining existing ones. Previous studies show that the temporary deferral of donors negatively impacts future donation likelihood. In this study, we analyze the impact of temporary deferrals on future donation behavior while correcting for potential endogeneity, depending on the level of donor experience and number of previous deferrals. Study Design and Method We use data from more than 123,000 whole blood donors of the Austrian Red Cross over a period of 5.5 years. We estimate logit models to analyze how a deferral affects future donation behavior while controlling for potential selection biases because donors are not deferred randomly. We control for gender, blood type, years since first donation, and number of previous donations and deferrals. We analyze the direct deferral effect, its interaction with donor experience, and the number of previous deferrals. Results Our results confirm that temporary deferrals hurt future donation behavior. This effect varies with donor experience and the number of previous deferrals. The effect is weaker with a higher number of previous donations and is stronger with a higher number of previous deferrals. The results suggest that donors learn to cope with deferrals the more they donate. However, the negative effect of deferrals amplifies over time, and each additional deferral decreases donation likelihood. Conclusion Blood banks that seek to overcome the negative effect of deferrals should be aware that this effect varies with donor experience and with the number of previous deferrals. Our results suggest that blood banks should focus on early-stage donors who are deferred because the negative deferral effect is stronger for more experienced donors. At the same time, blood banks should be careful with donor groups who have experienced deferrals in the past because every additional deferral demotivates future donation behavior. Overall, researchers should be careful to correct for endogeneity because our results suggest that ignoring these effects could lead to substantial underestimation of the negative deferral effect.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The consequences of temporary deferral are not well understood. This study sought to investigate blood donor return after deferral expiration. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort analysis of allogeneic whole-blood donation was conducted. All deferred donors and a random sample of eligible donors were identified from the year 2000, with subsequent blood center visits through December 2005 captured. Stratified results are reported as the percentage returning, rates of return, and time to return. Measures of statistical association and Cox regression modeling are reported. RESULTS: For first-time (FT) donors, 25 percent of temporarily deferred donors returned during the 5-year follow-up period compared to 47 percent of eligible donors (p {$<$} 0.0001); for repeat donors, 81 and 86 percent of deferred and eligible donors returned, respectively (p {$<$} 0.0001). Depending on the deferral category, 14 to 31 percent of FT and 58 to 90 percent of repeat donors returned. Rates (per year) of successful donation during the follow-up period were 0.09 for index-deferred FT donors, 0.28 for eligible FT donors, 1.0 for deferred repeat donors, and 1.45 for eligible repeat donors. Multivariate modeling indicated that in addition to deferral, age, sex, race, and education were associated with return in both FT and repeat donors. CONCLUSION: The effects of deferral were more pronounced than expected, affecting both FT and repeat donors. For FT donors, the type and duration of deferral, while important, were not as relevant as hypothesized because so few returned, suggesting the need to develop appropriate interventions to recapture those donors likely to be eligible.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The consequences of temporary predonation deferral are unsatisfactorily understood. Studies have found that deferral negatively impacts future donor return. However, the applicability of these findings across centers has not been established. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Using a cohort design, presenting donors with a temporary deferral in 2006 to 2008 in one of six categories (low hematocrit [Hct], blood pressure or pulse, feeling unwell, malaria travel, tattoos or piercing and related exposures, or could not wait or second thoughts) were passively followed for up to a 3-year period for the time to first return after deferral expiration at six US blood centers. Time-to-event methods were used to assess return. We also analyzed which donor characteristics were associated with return using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Of 3.9 million donor presentations, 505,623 resulted in deferral in the six categories. Low Hct was the most common deferral, had the shortest median time to return (time in days when 50\% of deferred donors had returned), and had the largest cumulative proportion of donors returning. Deferrals of shorter duration had better return. Longer-term deferrals (up to 1 year in length) had the lowest cumulative return proportion, which did not exceed 50\%. Return was associated with previously identified factors such as repeat donor status, older age, and higher educational attainment regardless of the type of deferral. In addition, return was associated with having been born in the United States and donation at fixed sites. CONCLUSION: The category of temporary deferral influences the likelihood of future return, but the demographic and donation factors associated with return are largely consistent regardless of the deferral.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Frequent blood donors are an important resource as they contribute many donations over their lifetime. The aim of this research was to develop a demographic profile of Australian frequent whole blood donors and to determine predictors of lapse within this group. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Routinely collected data were used to profile individuals who had donated whole blood frequently (three or more times) between December 2010 and November 2011. Two segments were identified: 1) existing donors who had donated before December 2010 and 2) new donors who had not donated before December 2010. Donation records were followed to the end of December 2013 to examine retention. RESULTS A total of 90,867 donated frequently between December 2010 and November 2011. The group was composed of slightly more men (51.4\%), was typically of middle socioeconomic status, and many were employed in skilled trades such as a builder or a plumber (21.3\%). Existing donors (n = 81,762) were significantly older, more likely to be male, and more likely to have a D\textendash{} blood type compared to the smaller group of new donors (n = 9105). For both segments, being older and male and having a D\textendash{} blood type increased the likelihood of return in the follow-up period. Deferrals and adverse events had negative impacts on retention for both groups. CONCLUSIONS This study highlights specific factors that blood collection agencies may focus on to support continued donation among frequent donors.},

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A random mail survey of first-time (FT) and repeat (RPT) current (donating within 6 months before survey) and lapsed (donating {$>$}2 years prior) donors was conducted. The self-administered questionnaire included questions on personal, social, and behavioral characteristics. RESULTS: Among 1280 current and 1672 lapsed donors with valid addresses, the participation rate was 66.8 and 39.2 percent, respectively. In FT donors, the odds of lapsing increased with education (odds ratio [OR], 2.18; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.34-3.55 for college or higher vs. Grade 12 or less education). Lapsed FT donors were more often asked to donate (OR, 1.89; 95\% CI, 1.32-2.70) and had less interest in incentives (p {$<$} 0.001) than current FT donors. In RPT donors, lapsed status was associated with being younger (p {$<$} 0.001) and female (OR, 1.19; 95\% CI, 1.00-1.42). Lapsed status was inversely associated with satisfaction with the last donation experience in both FT (p = 0.043) and RPT (p {$<$} 0.001) donors. Lapsed and current donors did not differ in perceived need for blood, personal transfusion experience, or mean reported altruistic behavior score. CONCLUSION: A positive donation experience appears to be a major determinant of donor return behavior. Lapsed donors do not appear, on average, to engage in fewer altruistic behaviors than currently active donors. Retention marketing strategies that appeal solely to altruistic values need to be further evaluated for their effectiveness.},

  abstract = {Background Donor eligibility assessment and subsequent return after deferral are key in maintaining an adequate and safe blood supply. Eligibility criteria should be reviewed regularly to ensure regional relevance and impact on donor deferral and return. Large-scale studies investigating donor deferral and return in Africa are currently lacking. Study design and methods Operationally collected blood donation data on whole blood donations at the South African National Blood Service during the five years from January 2015 to December 2019 were extracted and analysed. Separate multivariable logistic regression models for factors associated with donor deferral and donor return were developed. Results Of the 5 068 638 donor presentations, 869 840 (17{$\cdot$}2\%) resulted in deferral of which out of range haemoglobin was most common (45{$\cdot$}9\%). New (aOR 3{$\cdot$}99; 95\% CI 3{$\cdot$}97\textendash 4{$\cdot$}01), female (aOR 2{$\cdot$}51; 95\% CI 2{$\cdot$}50\textendash 2{$\cdot$}53) and Black African (aOR 1{$\cdot$}90; 95\% CI 1{$\cdot$}89\textendash 1{$\cdot$}91) donors had greater odds of being deferred compared to Repeat, male and White donors, respectively. Of the donors deferred during 2015\textendash 2018, 328 306 (47{$\cdot$}2\%) returned within 12 months. Odds of returning increased with increasing age. Lower odds of return were noted among female (aOR 0{$\cdot$}82; 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}81\textendash 0{$\cdot$}83) and Black African (aOR 0{$\cdot$}75; 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}74\textendash 0{$\cdot$}76) donors. Conclusion We confirmed high proportions of deferral among SANBS donors with almost half returning within 12 month. Donor deferral and return patterns differed significantly by donor characteristics, the latter also by deferral indication. Further understanding the interaction between haemoglobin deferral and changing donor demographics may assist in refining eligibility criteria and recruitment efforts.},

This pilot study investigates how deferral affects momentary mood, satisfaction with the donation process, and subsequent return behavior to examine their potential for motivating (deferred) FTD. \textbf{\emph{Methods:}} All of the subjects (\emph{n} = 96) completed a first questionnaire (A1) before pre-donation assessment. Deferred FTD (\emph{n} = 22) were asked to complete a second questionnaire (A2) immediately after deferral, while non-deferred FTD (\emph{n} = 74) filled in the second questionnaire (A3) after blood donation. The impact of deferral, momentary mood, and satisfaction with the donation process on return behavior within 12 months was tested by calculating two path analyses, controlling for sex and age. \textbf{\emph{Results:}} Mood (\emph{p} \&\#x3c; 0.001) and satisfaction with social aspects of the donation process (\emph{p} = 0.01) were decreased after deferral. Deferred FTD were less likely than non-deferred FTD to return to the blood donation center within 12 months (60.8 vs. 36.4\%; \emph{p} = 0.043). However, path analyses revealed that deferral effects on mood and satisfaction were not connected to return behavior. Instead, age had a significant influence on return behavior (\emph{p} \&\#x3c; 0.05) such that, overall, non-returning FTD were older than returning FTD, regardless of their deferral status. \textbf{\emph{Conclusion:}} Our findings suggest that mood and satisfaction with the donation process are directly affected by deferral but not clearly responsible for low return rates. It seems promising to embed these variables in established health behavior models in further studies to increase the return rates of deferred FTD.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study investigated the effects of a 6-month deferral due to low hemoglobin (Hb) on the subsequent donation patterns of Australian whole blood donors. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The study was a retrospective cohort study of the donation patterns of all whole blood donors deferred for low Hb during a 2-month period compared with donors who were not deferred. Donations 3 years after eligibility to give blood were recorded. Analysis of proportion returning, time to return, and frequency of donation was performed using logistic regression, survival analysis, and negative binomial regression. RESULTS: Among first-time donors, 20.9\% of low Hb\textendash deferred donors returned during the follow-up period versus 69.9\% of those not deferred. Among repeat donors, 64.0\% of deferred donors returned versus 91.0\% of those not deferred. Temporary deferral delayed time to first return (p {$<$} 0.001), reduced frequency of donation (2.4 donations per donor before deferral compared to 1.1 per donor in first year of follow-up), and increased the likelihood of dropping out in later years of follow-up. However, if a donor returned promptly once eligible and gave more donations in the first year, the negative impact on future donation patterns was diminished. High frequency of attendance before deferral was the strongest predictor of time to return and future donation frequency. CONCLUSION: Deferral for low Hb had a strong effect on first-time and repeat donors. This study highlights the influence of strong donation habits on return after deferral and the importance of encouraging donors to return promptly once eligible.},

There is little evidence on the size and prevalence of this negative association in settings with no such retention activities. Study Design and Methods We use data from more than 2 million donation attempts made at a blood collection agency in Brazil over a 26-year period. We describe the distribution of deferrals across donor demographic and behavioral characteristics, and estimate multivariate survival analysis models with matched samples to measure the impact of deferrals on return rates. We control for sex, race, age, education, donation type, number of previous attempts, previous donations, and previous deferrals. We test for heterogeneous effects in interaction models with selected donor demographic and behavioral characteristics. Results Temporary deferrals were associated with a 50\% decrease in the likelihood of return. Although the effect was observed for all population subgroups and across the full length of the dataset, it varied in magnitude. The influence of deferrals was more negative among older donors and those reporting replacement motives, and less negative among more educated donors and those with a previous donation. Discussion We found that temporary deferrals meaningfully harm donor careers in a setting where specific retention activities are absent. Although the effects are widespread across the population and persistent in time, there are also heterogeneities, which must be considered when designing interventions targeted at wining-back specific groups of deferred donors.},

More insight into this variation is important for blood banks in achieving stable stocks. This study examined individual factors determining intended show behaviour. Most importantly, however, this study is the first study to account for variation in donor behaviour across different collection sites. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We applied a multilevel approach to data from Donor InSight, including 11 889 donors from 257 fixed and mobile collection sites in the Netherlands. The aim of the multilevel models was to account for variance at two levels, that is donors and collection sites. We estimated the likelihood of showing after invitation based on individual predictors, including demographics, donation history and attitude. At the collection site level, we included satisfaction with the blood bank aggregated from individual responses by donors who donate at this site, opening hours and collection site type, that is fixed/mobile. RESULTS: Most importantly, show behaviour varied considerably across collection sites and depended on characteristics of these sites. Moreover, women, older and more experienced donors had higher odds of showing after invitation than men, younger and less experienced donors. Donors higher on warm glow, self-efficacy and donor identity more likely showed after an invitation. Higher aggregate satisfaction and donating at fixed collection sites increased the odds of show. CONCLUSION: In addition to individual factors, collection site characteristics are important in explaining variation in donor show behaviour, thus presenting clues for blood bank policies and interventions to improve donor show.},

The current study investigated reasons that deferred donors return to donate, despite having been notified that they are ineligible. STUDY DESIGN AND METHOD: Anonymous mail surveys requesting demographic information, details of last donation or attempted donation, and assessments of incentives for donating were sent to 311 donors presenting inappropriately at blood drives and 849 matched controls in three American Red Cross regions between April and July 1996. RESULTS: Responses were received from a total of 113 deferred donors and 388 matched controls. Analysis of the 49 permanently deferred donors indicated that they were more likely than controls to donate blood to receive test results or to be awarded community service credit. Responses also revealed that some deferred donors may return to donate blood because of a misunderstanding of the deferral message or erroneous recruitment by blood center staff. CONCLUSION: There is a need before donation for the provision of educational materials regarding the window period of infection and for careful consideration of the use of incentives to attract donors to blood centers. It is also important to provide to donors a clear and consistent message regarding their test results and deferral status.},

This study evaluated correlations between overall satisfaction with the donation process and donor demographics and the effect of both on a donor's intent to return. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: An anonymous, self-administered questionnaire was given to donors at multiple sites of one blood center over a 3-week period. First-time and repeat donors were asked questions on demographic characteristics, satisfaction with the current donation process, motivation for current and future donations, and intent to return. RESULTS: More than 75 percent of donors rated the overall donation process at 9 or 10 on a scale of 10 (mean, 9.19; standard deviation, 1.09), with female, high school\textendash educated, and first-time donors giving higher satisfaction ratings than male, college-educated, and repeat donors, respectively (all p {$<$} 0.001). Donor satisfaction was correlated with intent to return for another donation (p = 0.002). For the current donation, donors rated altruistic motivations most highly. Medical testing was the most highly rated incentive for future donations, followed by frequent donor programs and convenient donation times and locations; preferences varied by demographic subgroup. CONCLUSIONS: Blood donor satisfaction varies among demographic and donation history subgroups and is positively correlated with the intent to return for future donation. Although the primary motivation among all donors was altruism, incentives to future donation may need to be tailored according to demographic subgroups.},

  abstract = {Deferral from donation is usually for conditions that make the donor only temporarily unable to give. Based on questionnaires given to 1247 donors with subsequent follow-up of their donation records for 6 months, permanent psychological effects of deferral are suggested. Only one of 36 deferred first-time donors (2.8\%) compared with 27.3 percent of those who were not deferred returned for a second donation during the next 6 months. Among most first-time donors, temporary deferral may be interpreted psychologically as providing a permanent excuse for not donating.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: To predict future blood donation behavior and improve donor retention, it is important to understand the determinants of donor return. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A self-administered questionnaire was completed in 2003 by 7905 current donors. With data mining methods, all factors measured by the survey were ranked as possible predictors of actual return within 12 months. Significant factors were analyzed with logistic regression to determine predictors of intention and of actual return. RESULTS: Younger and minority donors were less likely to return in 12 months. Predictors of donor return were higher prior donation frequency, higher intention to return, a convenient place to donate, and having a good donation experience. Most factors associated with actual donor return were also associated with a high intention to return. Although not significant for actual return, feeling a responsibility to help others, higher empathetic concern, and a feeling that being a blood donor means more than just donating blood were related to high intention to return. CONCLUSION: Prior donation frequency, intention to return, donation experience, and having a convenient location appear to significantly predict donor return. Clearly, donor behavior is dependent on more than one factor alone. Altruistic behavior, empathy, and social responsibility items did not enter our model to predict actual return. A donor's stated intention to give again is positively related to actual return and, while not a perfect measure, might be a useful proxy when donor return cannot be determined.},

  abstract = {Background To prevent (negative consequences of) temporary deferral due to low hemoglobin, the Dutch national blood service Sanquin introduced a ferritin monitoring policy in 2017. Ferritin is measured after the donation (as opposed to before donation for hemoglobin), and low ferritin levels lead to deferral of 6 (ferritin 15-30 ng/mL) or 12 months (ferritin {$<$}15 ng/mL). We explored the consequences of this policy on donor behavior and availability. Study Design and Methods We included all Dutch whole blood donors who made a donation (attempt) between 13 November and 31 December 2017. At that point, the ferritin monitoring policy was randomly implemented in 8 of 29 regional clusters of collection centers. We extracted information from Sanquin's donor database about donors' deferrals, subsequent donation attempts, and donation cessation (up to 31 December 2019). Donors deferred for low ferritin were compared to those deferred for low hemoglobin or other reasons, as well as to donors who were not deferred. Results A total of 55 644 donors were included (11\% deferred). For donor behavior, we found that donors deferred for low ferritin less often unsubscribed and switched to other donation types, yet also made fewer donations in the follow-up period. For availability, we found they were less often deferred, yet they were unavailable to donate for a longer period. Conclusion Results suggest that the implementation of a ferritin monitoring policy may lead to a decrease in donor availability and reduced donations. However, the policy is successful in retaining more donors and reducing low hemoglobin deferrals.},
