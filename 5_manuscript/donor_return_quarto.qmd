NOTES:
-   To render both word and HTML, can type this into terminal

quarto render 5_manuscript/manuscript.qmd

-   There are limits in cross-referencing in Quarto. The table
   Caption doesn't work well with flextable package, and 
  There's no option for secondary (supplemental) series of 
  tables or figures. As workaround, we repurpose other
  series.I'm using
        @thm- for tables (Table X)
        @cor- for supplemental tables (Table SX)
        @lem- for supplemental figures (Figure SX)
  The space between "S" and the number for supplemental figures seems unavoidable
   for now. Can manually correct before submitting to journal.
        
Flextable package isn't playing nicely with quarto for crossreferencing at the 
moment but it's being actively worked on. To install latest package version, use 
  devtools::install_github("davidgohel/flextable")

>Modern health systems depend on a steady blood supply to meet urgent care needs in healthcare facilities. Blood donors have to undergo thorough medical, clinical and laboratory screening to ensure their welfare and safety as well as that of transfusion recipients. Therefore, blood collection sites have strict eligibility criteria that they adhere to, and donors who do not meet them are issued a temporary or permanent deferral. A donor who receives a permanent deferral for various reasons (such as a positive test for Hepatitis B or HIV) will never be eligible to donate blood. However, when a donor receives a temporary deferral (such as for travel or a recent vaccine), they are deemed ineligible for a short period of time and are allowed to return to donate once the period has passed. It is shown that every additional deferral decreases the donor’s likelihood of returning for a donation (Clement M, et al., 2021).

>One of the most common temporary deferrals is for low haemoglobin levels. Blood collection sites issue haemoglobin deferrals to donors whose fingerstick haemoglobin levels are below a threshold (below 13.0 mg/L for male donors and 12.5 mg/L for female).Low haemoglobin deferrals have a very strong effect on return behaviour for first-time and repeat donors (Hillgrove et al., 2011).  Previous studies found that donors who are deferred for low haemoglobin at the first attempted donation are very unlikely to ever return to try to donate (Mast et al., 2010; Custer et al., 2011). This suggests the importance of blood banks evaluating their deferral policies and understanding the significance of encouraging donors to return promptly once eligible. 

>Further research shows that besides individual factors, collection site characteristics are essential in predicting the differences in donor return behaviour. Using a multilevel model, a Dutch study found that returns varied across collection sites, and fixed sites were associated with higher donor satisfaction and likelihood of donor return (Merz et al.,2017). Donor return has been associated with factors such as repeat donor status, older age, higher educational attainment, birth in the United States and donation at fixed sites (Custer et al., 2011). A 2012 U.S. study investigated the effects of fixed or mobile donation with differing sponsor types on donation return time and found the shortest return time among fixed-site donors and those alternating between fixed and mobile sites (Carey PM, et al., 2012). However, mobile collection sites represent a large share of blood collection in many countries and as blood centres around the world consider changes to donor deferral criteria, understanding the impact on donor return behaviour, particularly mobile donors, is critical to make certain policy changes will not threaten the fragile blood supply.

>Blood centres also impose an interval between successful donations containing a single red blood cell unit to reduce the risk of iron deficiency in donors (56 days in the US and South Africa). This allows donors to donate a maximum of five times a year. The ageing donor base and loss of donors during the COVID-19 pandemic have made it harder for blood centres to retain donors and meet blood collection requirements. Therefore, making an informed decision about potential changes to inter-donation intervals and deferral policies while preventing donor iron deficiency depends on how such policies impact long-term returns. In this study, we use operational blood donor data from the United States and South Africa to improve understanding of donor return dynamics at mobile and fixed collection sites during pre- and intra-COVID-19 periods to inform blood donor management policy.

# Methods

## Data

>We used operational data from the South African National Blood Service (SANBS), South Africa, and Vitalant, United States (US).  SANBS is the largest blood collector in South Africa, and Vitalant is the second-largest blood collector in the US. All donations are voluntary and non-remunerated. We included donor visits from the year 2017 to 2022 in this analysis. We extracted demographic information (age, sex, education, race/ethnicity, height, weight), donation environment (fixed or mobile), and other characteristics (blood type, reason for deferral, haemoglobin value, donation date, donation procedure, and donation outcome). Donor visits from the years 2015 to 2017 were used to create donor history variables such as units of red blood cell loss in the last 12 months and 24 months since the index donation, days since the last red blood cell loss, and days since the last double red blood cell loss, and cumulative lifetime donations.  

>We classified the outcome for each visit based on the reason for deferral, haemoglobin value and status of donation as either (1) completed donation, (2) haemoglobin deferral or (3) other deferrals. Time until return was calculated from the day the donor was eligible to donate again, their “eligibility date” (figure 1). The eligibility date is 56 days after a completed whole blood donation. For deferrals, the eligibility date is the end of the deferral period (1 day in the US; 3 to 6 months in South Africa). The data was right-censored due to the end of the data collection period or no return. Additionally, a 'fixed-mobile pattern' variable was defined for each visit as: (1) returning to a fixed site after donation at a fixed site (FF), (2) returning to a mobile drive after donation at a fixed site (FM), (3) returning to a fixed site after donation at a mobile drive (MF), and (4) returning to a mobile drive after donation at a mobile drive (MM).

>We analysed the return after a donation that was a whole blood product (red blood cell donations were excluded due to a longer inter-donation interval) between the years 2017 to 2022. Only allogeneic donations (when a donor and a recipient are not the same person) were included as the index donation. Furthermore, donors who received permanent deferrals were excluded entirely. 


## Kaplan Meier Analysis
>An analysis of donor returns times stratified by outcome type (completed donation, haemoglobin deferral, and other deferrals) was conducted using Kaplan Meier analysis. It determines the time of first return, and cumulative pattern of return and estimates the survival function for different outcomes while controlling for right censoring.

## Cumulative Incidence Functions
> To analyse switching between mobile and fixed donation environments, we developed survival curves stratified by fixed–mobile pattern to determine the pattern of return between donation environments and the loyalty donors have to the collection site type. In this case, since we are looking at competing events (returning to mobile drive vs. returning to a fixed site), we utilised cause-specific cumulative incidence functions (CIF). We developed separate models for first-time and repeat donors, and the outcomes, haemoglobin deferral and completed donation.

## Lasso Penalised Cox Proportional Hazards Analysis
>We implemented four penalised Cox Proportional Hazards models with a lasso penalty to determine factors influencing donor return time. We added a lasso penalty term to the model to decrease complexity, and mitigate the impact of collinearity among predictors by shrinking the less relevant predictors towards zero, thereby performing feature selection (Srinivasan S, et al., 2017). We developed separate models for fixed sites and mobile drives during the pre- and intra-pandemic (COVID-19) periods. Predictors in the analysis included outcome type, race, sex, age at the time of the visit, blood type, height, weight, country of birth, education level, haemoglobin level at the time of donation, donation product, first-time donor status, and donor history variables such as red blood cell loss in the last 12 and 24 months, and cumulative lifetime donations. Covariates indicating whether the donor is a teenager, and the opportunities to donate at the same mobile drive were included. Interaction terms between first-time donors and haemoglobin deferrals were also included.  
We conducted all data analyses using Python (Version 3.11.3).

# Results
In total, the population consisted of 3,658,560 successful donations and 439,099 deferrals of which 53% were hemoglobin deferrals

Out of 4,286,365 visits made by 596,176 donors, 48% were at fixed sites, and 13% resulted in a deferral. Haemoglobin deferrals occurred at 4% of visits to a fixed site and 6% of visits to a mobile drive. After a completed donation, the median time to return from when a donor is eligible was 70 days at fixed sites and 106 days at mobile drives. After a haemoglobin deferral, the median return time was longer: 138 days at fixed sites and 190 days at mobile drives.

The lasso-penalised Cox proportional hazards model had an average cross-validated concordance index of 0.67. Male donors (hazard ratio [HR] of 1.21), black South African donors (HR of 1.02) and donating at a fixed site (HR of 1.03) were associated with a shorter time to return. Female donors (HR of 0.97), first-time donors (hazard ratio of 0.84) and haemoglobin deferrals (HR of 0.9) were associated with longer return times. Interaction terms indicated that first-time donors returned later at fixed sites vs mobile  (HR of 0.96), and haemoglobin deferred donors returned earlier at fixed sites vs mobile (HR of 1.04).

Of all the visits, 48% were to a fixed site and 52% were to a mobile site. 4% of visits to a fixed site
result in a haemoglobin deferral, and 6% of visits to a mobile drive. After a completed donation, the median return time from
when a donor is first eligible was 70 days at fixed sites and 106 days at mobile drives. After a haemoglobin deferral, the
median return time was longer: 138 days at fixed sites and 190 days at mobile drives. For first-time donors, the median return
time after a haemoglobin deferral was longer: 225 days at a fixed site and 259 days at mobile drives. In our proportional
hazard mode, visiting a fixed collection site was associated with a shorter time to return (log hazard ratio of 0.46) and
haemoglobin deferral was associated with a longer time to return (log hazard ratio of -0.44).

# A. Supplement section
We imputed deferred observations with unknown donation products as “Whole Blood (WB)” if the most proximal subsequent or previous donation (for which the donation procedure was not unknown) was ‘WB’. We also assumed that the intended donation was ‘Whole Blood’ if the donor only ever had deferred visits or if it was a first-time donor with a deferred visit since whole blood is the most common donation procedure.
