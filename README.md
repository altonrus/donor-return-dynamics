Code repository for the manuscript 'Donor Return Behavior in South Africa and the United States at Mobile Drives and Fixed Donation Sites.' by Huzbah Jagirdar et. al.

The `1_data` directory contains data we are able to share publicly. This does not include the patient level data from SANBS and Vitalant. Because those data are not public, this repository can not be used to replicate our findings. However, the directory includes the the data description tables.

The `2_scripts` directory includes all code run to generate the analysis.

The `3_output` contains figures and tables generated by the scripts in `2_scripts`, most of which are used in the manuscript.
